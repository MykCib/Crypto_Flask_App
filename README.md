# YearToDate

[A website](yeartodate.pythonanywhere.com/) to display Bitcoin and Ethereum perfomance since the beginning of the current year.

This Python script was first written as a [Twitter Bot](https://github.com/MykCib/TwitterCryptoBot) and then adjusted for a Flask App running on [PythonAnywehre](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).

Cryptocurrency prices are taken from [Cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/).
